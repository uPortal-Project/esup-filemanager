## Portlet Preferences

Even if the most part of configurations is set on drives.xml, you can also define some portlet preferences when registering/publishing an "Esup File Manager" Portlet.

* `defaultPortletView` can be equals to standard, wai or mobile
* `defaultPath` that's the default path which is opened when the user displays the portlet (if defaultPath is multi-valued, the first available is choosed).
* `contextToken` it allows to show only some drives (that have the same contextToken set up on drives.xml)
* `showHiddenFiles` to hide/show 'hidden files'
* `useDoubleClick` use of double click when browsing
* `useCursorWaitDialog` display a waiting dialog when loading

Some of this preferences can also be edited by user himself with the "edit portlet mode".
